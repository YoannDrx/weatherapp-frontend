#  📚 Weather App

Hi,
I'm Yoann, I'm currently deepening my knowledge in web development. I'm specialized in React frontend development.
I had fun coding all these projects!
Don't hesitate if you have any questions, and have a look at my other projects ;)
Have fun coding!

## ✍️ Description 

WeatherApp is an application that displays the weather for the cities you enter.

(API : [https://openweathermap.org/api](https://openweathermap.org/api))

The WeatherApp project is split into four parts. In the first part, you will build the backend of the application as a webservice that will retrieve weather information. All the weather data is stored in the global variable named "weather," and you will not need any external API.

In the second part of the project, you will integrate a third-party service to the backend webservice: the OpenWeatherMap API. This will make the application more practical, and you will need to communicate with the frontend to display the weather of the chosen cities.

In the third part of the project, you will focus on organizing the routes and introducing a database to store the weather information permanently. This will make the application more structured and scalable.

The fourth and final part of the project will introduce a registration/login mechanism on the backend. On the frontend, you will need to integrate and manage the new page dedicated to the user login.

Overall, this project will allow you to apply your knowledge of HTML, CSS, responsiveness, backend development, and client/server communication. You will learn how to integrate external APIs and organize your routes and data storage to make the application more scalable and user-friendly.
